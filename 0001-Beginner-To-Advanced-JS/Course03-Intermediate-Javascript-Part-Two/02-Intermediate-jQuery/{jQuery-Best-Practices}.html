<!-- Selector Caching -->

<!-- As we start building larger applications with jQuery, we can make those applications more efficient by caching our selectors. 
    What this means is that when we find elements in the DOM that we will be using repeatedly, we should find them once and save 
    them to variables. Here's an example: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="container"></div>
    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(function () {
            var $container = $("#container");

            $container.text("Hello World!");
            $container.css('color', 'red');
            $container.on("mouseenter", function (e) {
                console.log("moused over!");
            });

            var $newDiv = $("<div>", {
                text: "I am a div!",
                css: {
                    color: "green"
                }
            });

            $container.append($newDiv);
        });
    </script>
</body>

</html>

<!-- In this case, jQuery only needs to go into the DOM and search for the div with an id of container one time. Since we store 
        that jQuery object in a variable, we don't need to go back into the DOM and search for the element again on subsequent lines. 
        We've also started our variable name with a dollar sign: this isn't required, but it's a nice convention. It indicates to the 
        reader that the value inside of the variable is a jQuery object. -->



<!-- Chaining -->

<!-- One of the nicest things about jQuery is the ability to chain functions together. What this allows us to do is something like this: -->

<script>
    $("div").first().parent().find(".projects").css("color", "red").fadeOut(200);

    // this can also be written as:

    $("div")
        .first()
        .parent()
        .find(".projects")
        .css("color", "red")
        .fadeOut(200);
</script>

<!-- jQuery Iterators -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Long list</title>
</head>

<body>
    <ul>
        Profit/Loss by Day
        <li>-$10</li>
        <li>$9</li>
        <li>$1</li>
        <li>$1</li>
        <li>$0</li>
        <li>$0</li>
        <li>$10</li>
        <li>-$7</li>
        <li>-$6</li>
        <li>-$9</li>
    </ul>
    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js"></script>
</body>

</html>

<script>
    for (var i = 0; i < $("li").length; i++) {
        console.log("Day " + i + ": " + $("li").eq(i).text());
    }
</script>
<!-- each -->

<!-- 
    One way to refactor the code above is to use jQuery's built-in each function. each accepts a callback, and that callback 
    can take two arguments: the first refers to the current index (analogous to i in the above example), and the second refers 
    to the current element corresponding to that index.
 -->

<script>
    $("li").each(function (i, el) {
        console.log("Day " + i + ": " + $(el).text());
    });
</script>

<!-- map -->

<!-- 
    jQuery has another iterator called map. The structure of this iterator is similar, but it does different things. map creates a 
    new jQuery object that contains the return values from the callback inside of map. This is why, when using map, you need to be 
    sure to always return something inside of the callback.
 -->

<script>
    var summary = $("li").map(function (i, el) {
        return $("<p>", {
            text: "On day " + i + ", I earned " + $(el).text()
        });
    });
    // summary is now a jQuery object which contains one p tag for each li

    $("body").append(summary.get());
// this appends the summary to the page.
// The .get method turns summary, a jQuery object, into an array.
// Without invoking get, you'll receive a TypeError.
</script>

<!-- filter -->

<!-- 
    There's a third iterator available to you in jQuery, called filter. Filter takes elements out of a jQuery object if they fail 
    some test provided by the callback (very similar to the native filter array method). For example, suppose we wanted red text 
    highlighting the days we lost money. Here's how we could achieve that effect using filter: 
-->

<script>
    $("li").filter(function (i, el) {
        return $(el).text()[0] === "-"
        // returns true if the first character in the text is a minus sign,
        // i.e. this checks whether or not the number is negative
    }).css('color', 'red');
// We've chained filter and css together; filter returns to us the
// li's with negative numbers in them, and we then style those li's
// to have red text.
</script>
