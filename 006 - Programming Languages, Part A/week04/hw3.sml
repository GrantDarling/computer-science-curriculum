1. The first argument should be applied to elements of the second
argument. 

2. If it returns NONE for any element, then the result for all_answers is NONE

3. Else the calls to the first argument will have produced SOME lst1, SOME lst2, ... SOME lstn and the result of
all_answers is SOME lst where lst is lst1, lst2, ..., lstn appended together (order doesnâ€™t matter).

Hints: The sample solution is 8 lines. It uses a helper function with an accumulator and uses @. Note
all_answers f [] should evaluate to SOME []
