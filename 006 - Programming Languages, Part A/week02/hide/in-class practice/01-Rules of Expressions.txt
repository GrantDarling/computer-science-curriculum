1. Syntax:
a < b
Where < is the keyword to evaluate the subexpressions 'a' and 'b'

2. Type Checking 
both a and b must be type 'int' to be compared.
the entire expression will result in a bool expression

3. Evaluation Rules
if a is less than type b then evaluate to true 




The dates can be checked as a list with tuples of integers to represent dates.
