# Programming Languages, Part A

## Description
This is an intermediate level course with an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. 
The course uses the languages Standard ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” 
to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

### Topics Covered in part B

Dynamic types, parenthesis in languages (ie: Lisp-family), delayed evaluations (streams and thunks), Macros, structs, interpreters, closures, static vs dynamic checking 

### Executing program

1. All programs can be run in Dr Racket (https://racket-lang.org/)
