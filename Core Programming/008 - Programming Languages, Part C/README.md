# Programming Languages, Part A

## Description
This is an intermediate level course with an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. 
The course uses the languages Standard ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” 
to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

### Topics Covered in part C

Dynamically typed object oriented programming languages, OOP vs Functional Programming decomposition, multiple inheritance, mixins, sub-typing

### Executing program

Executing these programs can be a bit of a pain... You can follow the instructions linked below. It is important to be running an older version of Ruby (2.2) as the graphical interface is dependent on this version (or 2.0 - 2.3)
